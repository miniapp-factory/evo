+Code the following app
+```
+You are an expert game developer. Generate code and game logic for a Snake & Ball game to display on the home page. 
+
+Game Requirements:
+- Player controls a snake that moves around the screen using a joystick (mobile) or arrow keys (desktop).
+- Snake collects balls that spawn randomly on the screen.
+- Each ball gives 1 point; collecting balls increases the snake's speed slightly.
+- The snake grows longer as it collects balls.
+- If the snake hits a wall or its own tail, the game ends.
+- Display a leaderboard below the game showing top scores.
+- Use conditional render to check if a player wins a milestone (like collecting a certain number of balls) and display a win message.
+- The player can always continue playing or start a new game after death.
+- Include optional Web3 features:
+    - Each player can have a snake NFT with traits (speed, size, color).
+    - Balls collected can award tokens ($SNAKE or $BALL) to the player's wallet.
+    - Rare achievements or milestones can mint new NFTs to the player's wallet.
+
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
