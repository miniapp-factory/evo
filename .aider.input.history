+Code the following app
+```
+You are an expert game developer. Generate code and game logic for a Snake & Ball game to display on the home page. 
+
+Game Requirements:
+- Player controls a snake that moves around the screen using a joystick (mobile) or arrow keys (desktop).
+- Snake collects balls that spawn randomly on the screen.
+- Each ball gives 1 point; collecting balls increases the snake's speed slightly.
+- The snake grows longer as it collects balls.
+- If the snake hits a wall or its own tail, the game ends.
+- Display a leaderboard below the game showing top scores.
+- Use conditional render to check if a player wins a milestone (like collecting a certain number of balls) and display a win message.
+- The player can always continue playing or start a new game after death.
+- Include optional Web3 features:
+    - Each player can have a snake NFT with traits (speed, size, color).
+    - Balls collected can award tokens ($SNAKE or $BALL) to the player's wallet.
+    - Rare achievements or milestones can mint new NFTs to the player's wallet.
+
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+- Each ball gives 1 point and slightly increases snake speed.
+- Snake grows longer with each ball collected.
+- Hitting a wall or own tail ends the game.
+- Display a leaderboard below the game showing top scores linked to wallet addresses.
+- Use conditional rendering to check milestone wins (collecting X balls or reaching length Y) and display a shareable win message.
+- Player can always start a new game after death.
+- Introduce new gameplay twists to differentiate from classic Snake:
+    - Some balls trigger “mutation effects” like temporary speed boost, tail shield, double points, or camouflage.
+    - Rare balls or milestones can unlock **snake evolution stages** (Tiny → Agile → Armored → Legendary), updating NFT metadata.
+    - Special skins, tail effects, or particles for milestones and rare mutations.
+    - Milestones, mutations, and evolution updates are shareable on the social feed.
+
+Web3 & NFT Features:
+- Each player has a snake NFT with traits: speed, size, color, tail effects.
+- Collecting balls gives tokens ($BALL or $SNAKE) to the player's wallet.
+- Rare balls or achievements mint new NFT traits or evolution levels.
+
+Visuals & Animations:
+- Snake growth, speed changes, and tail effects are visible.
+- Smooth animations for snake movement and tail growth.
+- Particle effects or glows when collecting rare balls or hitting milestones.
+- Win and milestone notifications appear overlayed and shareable.
+
+Make the code lightweight, optimized for performance
