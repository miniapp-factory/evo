+Code the following app

+You are an expert game developer. Generate code and game logic for a Snake & Ball game to display on the home page. 
+
+Game Requirements:
+- Player controls a snake that moves around the screen using a joystick (mobile) or arrow keys (desktop).
+- Snake collects balls that spawn randomly on the screen.
+- Each ball gives 1 point; collecting balls increases the snake's speed slightly.
+- The snake grows longer as it collects balls.
+- If the snake hits a wall or its own tail, the game ends.
+- Display a leaderboard below the game showing top scores.
+- Use conditional render to check if a player wins a milestone (like collecting a certain number of balls) and display a win message.
+- The player can always continue playing or start a new game after death.
+- Include optional Web3 features:
+    - Each player can have a snake NFT with traits (speed, size, color).
+    - Balls collected can award tokens ($SNAKE or $BALL) to the player's wallet.
+    - Rare achievements or milestones can mint new NFTs to the player's wallet.

+- Player can always start a new game after death.
+- Introduce new gameplay twists to differentiate from classic Snake:
+    - Some balls trigger “mutation effects” like temporary speed boost, tail shield, double points, or camouflage.
+    - Rare balls or milestones can unlock **snake evolution stages** (Tiny → Agile → Armored → Legendary), updating NFT metadata.
+    - Special skins, tail effects, or particles for milestones and rare mutations.
+    - Milestones, mutations, and evolution updates are shareable on the social feed.
